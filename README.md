This is the starter node of the Alternetâ€”a forkable, printable, zine-based publishing model designed to persist through anything.

## WHAT THIS IS

- A structure to build and host your own Alternet node
- Templates for zines, feeds, trust files, and CLI readers
- Scripts to bundle your node as a `.zip`, `.gitbundle`, or `.torrent`
- A central mirror list (`mirrors.txt`)
- Suggested rituals for publishing, signing, and sharing

## WHAT TO DO

1. **Fork or clone** this repo
2. **Do NOT add zines here**
3. Instead, create a new repo:
   - `alternet-yourfeedname/`
   - Add zines in `/zines/`
   - Add feeds in `/feeds/`
   - Reference back to this repo if needed
4. Optionally use:
   - GitHub Pages
   - GitTorrent
   - IPFS
   - ASCII terminal reader
